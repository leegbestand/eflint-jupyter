    "An identifier plays the role of a constructor (for creating instances) when provided with arguments as part of a constructor-application. For example, the expression `voter(Alice)` applies the identifier `voter` as a constructor to the string `Alice`. That `Alice` is a valid instance of `citizen` is inferred from the type of `voter`.  The same instance is also produced by the expression `voter(citizen(Alice))`. The inner constructor application is an example of a applying an identifier as a constructor to a literal to create an instance of a primitive type. \n",
    "\n",
    "An other example of constructor application is `vote(Alice,Chloe)`, constructing an instance representing the potential fact that `Alice`  has voted on `Chloe`. In this example, the relative positioning of the arguments is important. The first argument must be a valid instance of `citizen` and the second argument must be a valid instance of `candidate`, as determined by the type of `vote`. The type of `vote` also determines that exactly two arguments need to be given, as its record-type has two fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "In another style of constructor application, the arguments are labelled with the field names for which they provide instances. For example, in the expression `voter(candidate = Alice)`, it is made explicit that `Alice` is to take up the role of `candidate` in the created instance for `voter`. There are two benefits to using this style: arguments can be written in any order, and arguments can be omitted. When an argument is omitted, the constructor application is automatically completed with variables for the missing identifiers. For example `vote(candidate = Chloe)` is equivalent to `vote(candidate = Chloe, citizen = citizen)`. Note that both these expressions are only valid if the variable `citizen` is bound by the context in which they appear. Depending on where an expression with unbound variables occurs, the variables are implicitly bound, as discussed later. This style of constructor application is only available for constructors of composite types.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Quanitifiers and iterating expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "As suggested before, every occurrence of a variable must be 'bound' by the context in which the variable occurs. Bindings are introduced, for example, by the `Exists` operator, written as `(Exists x1,...,xn : e)`, where `x1,…,xn` are ‘binders’ -- variables for which bindings will be introduced -- and `e` is a Boolean expression. All occurrences of the variables `x1,...,xn` are bound inside `e`. The semantics of `(Exists x1,...,xn : e)` are to determine whether there is a valid combination of instances for the variables `x1,...,xn` so that `e` evaluates to `True`, returning `True` if this is the case and `False` otherwise. The expression `(Exists x1,...,xn : e)` is nondeterministic in the sense that `e` is evaluated an unspecified amount of times and in an unspecified order. However, it is 'effectively deterministic' because the outcome of evaluation is the same regardless (assuming implementations are sound with respect to the given semantics). The `Forall` operator is written similarly and returns True only if all combinators of instances of the variables `x1,...xn` result in `e` evaluating to True. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the possible bindings of a variable `x` to instances of its type `t` are enumerated it might be the case that `t` has an unbounded domain (e.g. `String`, representing the domain of all strings). In this case all instances of `t` that hold true in the current situation are enumerated instead. This practical design decision makes it possible to use eFLINT specifications both at runtime (when domains are typically unbounded) and statically with a known or chosen bounded domains. Besides `Exists` and `Forall`, also the `Foreach` operator, introduced below, provides bindings by enumerating instances."

By using the `Foreach` operator, written as `(Foreach x1,...,xn: e)`, an instance expression `e` is evaluated multiple times, for all combinators of bindings to `x1,...xn`, collecting all instances produced by these evaluations. As such, an occurrence of `Foreach` yields zero, one or more instances. The `Foreach` operator can be used only as the outermost operator of certain clauses, such as `Derived from`, `Creates` and `Terminates` (introduced below), and as the top-level sub-expression of an aggregator (see below). This design decision ensures the language is 'effectively deterministic'.\n",

The `Foreach`-operator has the same syntax as `Exists` and `Forall` (except for the keyword name) and expressions formed by the `Foreach`-operator may produce multiple result instances, at most one for each evaluation of its sub-expression.
