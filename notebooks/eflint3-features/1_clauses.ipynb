    "# 1. Flexible type-decarations\n",
    "Type-declarations consists of a number of clauses, some of which are used only in, for example, act- or duty-type declarations, whereas others can be used in all type-declarations. In the first versions of eFLINT, and depending on which kind of type is declared, certain clauses are mandatory and need to be written in a fixed order. In eflint-3.0, a lot more flexibility is introduced, making additional clauses optional and allowing many clauses to be written in any order. This notebook clarifies the exact rules applicable to the different kinds of type-declarations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since eflint-2.0, there are two types of type-declarations: declarations that *introduce* a new type (or replace an existing one) and declarations that *extend* an existing type. The clauses that can be written in a type extension are henceforth refered to as the *accumulating* clauses, the other clauses are *domain-related* clauses. The sections of this notebook discuss the domain-related and accumulating clauses of the different kinds of type-declarations."
