    "# 2. Conjuctive and disjunctive conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous versions of eFLINT, `Conditioned by` clauses could only be associated with actions to determine whether these actions are `Enabled`, i.e. do *not* cause violations when they are triggered. Experiments showed the value of impliciting using logical conjunction to combine multiple conditions expressed using `Conditioned by`, whether as part of a single declaration or through the use of `Extend`. The combination of the *conjuctive*  `Conditioned by` clauses and the *disjunctive* `Holds when` (and `Derived from`) clauses proved very expressive, in a way that is also useful for other kinds of types. \n",
    "\n",
    "In eFLINT-3.0, the role of `Conditioned by` clauses has changed. These clauses can now also be associated with the other kinds of types, i.e. fact-types, duty-types and event-types. Moreover, they are not only used to determine whether an instance of a type is `Enabled`, but act as a kind of filter on derivation rules. That is, an instance of a type is considered to be *derivable* if one or more of its derivation rules say it is **and** if all conditions of the type are satisfied. (As a consequence, the only difference between `Holds` and `Enabled` is on instances whose truth is postulated rather than derived and whose type has one or more conditions associated with it.)\n",

    "To demonstrate the expressiveness of conjuctive and disjunctive conditions this notebook works out an example of an exception on an exception. "
